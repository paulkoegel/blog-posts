Fresh on our Radar: React Native
================================

The big news of this week's [React.js Conf](http://conf.reactjs.com) was the announcement of React Native, a way to build native iOS and Android apps with Facebook's React.

React Native is Facebook's solution for writing "hybrid" web apps - with a twist. Traditional hybrid apps wrap a WebView (lightweight browser, [more information](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/10/21/providing-a-native-experience-with-web-technologies)) and your app's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in a native app package. When the app is opened, a web view gets initialised and your code gets executed on it. Apps written with React Native, however, do not require a WebView but render directly to native views. This approach is similar to what [Titanium](http://www.appcelerator.com/titanium) does, with some [differences](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8962528), though.

### What is React?
When released: "The V in MVC" (ironic comment "'React is the V' just like my iPhone is just a phone. #reactjsconf" [https://twitter.com/_chenglou/status/560699868641886208](https://twitter.com/_chenglou/status/560699868641886208))

Facebook has a history with HTML5 and native apps: http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/mark-zuckerberg-our-biggest-mistake-with-mobile-was-betting-too-much-on-html5
which prompted Sencha to prove them wrong and release the following demo where they rebuilt Facebook's iOS app with Sencha in HTML5: http://www.sencha.com/blog/the-making-of-fastbook-an-html5-love-story

Problem remains: some stuff you cannot do with web views.

Pros
+ "Learn once run anywhere!" developers only need to know React to write apps for the web, Android, and iOS.
+ Requires no web view, JavaScript runtime is much smaller.
+ Renders native views with native behaviour.
+ Is already being used in production: [Facebook Groups on iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/facebook-groups/id931735837).


Cons
+ Dependent on API that React Native provides. You can only call native classes and methods (Objective C/Swift on iOS or Java on Android) from your React code (JavaScript) that are supported by React Native.
+ You will have more power and control - especially in terms of performance fine-tuning - when you write 
+ Requires a JavaScript runtime that pure native apps don't need.
+ Hasn't been released yet :) But is coming in the next couple of days.


### NOT "WRITE ONCE RUN ANYWHERE" BUT "LEARN ONCE RUN ANYWHERE"
